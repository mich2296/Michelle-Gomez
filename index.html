<h1>Michelle Gomez</h1>
<p>My name is Michelle Gomez, and I am from Queens. My work is photography, specifically behind the scenes, fashion, or concerts. I aim to expand my work and explore opportunities in international or travel photography. I want to capture the diverse cultures and landscapes of various places, both domestically and internationally. I plan to capture that through the people, their clothing, the food, and their overall lifestyle. I got my first start in photography about a year and a half ago when I quit my job as a stylist at Nike. My best friend owns a marketing agency, and I bought a Fujifilm T-30ii (my first baby) as my primary photographer. 
	In fashion photography, I use the city as my background to capture the essence of the New York scene and culture, particularly in Harlem, by styling clothes and creating relatable storylines, such as going to the corner store for a sandwich. In behind-the-scenes photography, I focus on the actions of the people and the setting to give the viewer a feel of what was going on. Lastly, in concert photography, I focus on the crowd’s expression as well as the engagement of the artist with the crowd. I think that’s the best way to capture the emotion of being at the concert, rather than just focusing on the artist performing or behind the scenes.
